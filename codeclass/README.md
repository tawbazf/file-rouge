## Project Structure

- **Controllers:**  
  - `DashboardProfController.php`: Handles teacher dashboard functionalities.
  - `ProjetController.php`: Manages CRUD operations for projects.
  - `DroitController.php`: Manages rights and permissions, ensuring that only teachers can update user rights.
  - Other controllers handle code collaboration and review functionalities.

- **Views:**  
  - Located in `resources/views`. Key views include:
    - `dashboardProf.blade.php` for the teacher dashboard.
    - `projects/` for managing projects.
    - `badge.blade.php` for managing badges.
    - More views for code collaboration, code reviews, and statistics.

- **Models:**  
  - `User.php` (with role and permissions handling)
  - `Project.php` (CRUD for projects)
  - `Badge.php` (for badge management)

## User Roles & Permissions

- **Teacher:**  
  - Access to full functionalities including project creation, rights assignment, and code review.
  
- **Student:**  
  - Limited access focusing primarily on viewing projects and collaborating in real time.

The rights management logic is implemented in the `DroitController.php`. Teachers can update other usersâ€™ roles and permissions either via a many-to-many relationship or by storing permissions in JSON.
